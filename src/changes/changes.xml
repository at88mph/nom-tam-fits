      <action type="fix" dev="attipaci" issue="596" due-to="keastrid">
          Botched compression of multicolumn tables, resulting in extra rows in the compressed table (as many rows as
          there were total table tiles across all columns).

      <action type="fix" dev="attipaci" issue="610">
          Standard.TNULLn keyword can take any argument type (was previously restricted to strings only).

          MultiArrayIterator fixes to size() and deepComponentType() methods.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="586">
          Default column names. Some tools, including (C)FITSIO have issues dealing with table columns that have no
          CTYPEn keywords set to define column names. Therefore to enhance interoperability we will use 'Column N'
          type naming, until the user sets a column name otherwise.          
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="611">
          New Quantizer class to handle generic decimal-integer conversions in line with the FITS specification for 
          integer representation of floating-point data. The new class will interpret the necessary header keywords for 
          both images and tables, and can fill the required values in FITS headers.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="611">
          ImageData.setQuantizer() / .getQuantizer() and BinaryTable.ColumnDesc.setQuantizer() / .getQuantizer()
          methods to access the quantizers that handle decimal-integer conversions for images and binary table 
          columns, respectively.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="610">
      	 ImageData.convertTo(Class type) will return the equivalent image data with another storage type (but 
      	 otherwise the same as the original image). Any decimal-integer conversion is handled by the image's own 
      	 quantizer (which is either specified in the image header or else set by the user) if it is available.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="610">
          New BinaryTable.getArrayElement(row, col) and .getArrayElementAs(int row, int col, Class asType) methods to 
          return the table element as an array always (without the boxing of scalar entries). The former is similar to 
          the original .getElement() method except that it represents FITS logicals as Boolean[]..., bits as 
          boolean[]..., and complex values a ComplexValue[]... arrays. The second form allows accessing numerical table 
         elements as arrays of a desired other numerical type. 
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="610">
         ArrayFuncs.convertArray(Object array, Class newType, Quantizer quant) method provides generic conversions 
         to numerical type arrays, including ComplexValue type arrays, and can be used for explicit quantization 
         conversions outside of images and table columns.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="592">
         ImageData now supports complex valued images as per the FITS standard, both when constructed programatically 
         from ComplexValue[]... data; or if so described with an image axis whose CTYPEn header value is 'COMPLEX' and 
         the axis contains 2 components (so long as the complex axis is either the first or last axis). The latter is 
         true even if integer representation is used in the FITS, e.g. via a quantization. When reading complex valued 
         images, the native ImageData is that of the stored type (e.g. float[]..[2] or float[2]..[]) for 
         compatibility, but ImageData.convertTo(ComplexValue.class) or .convertTo(ComplexValue.Float.class) can 
         convert these to be true complex valued images in a second step after reading. (You may also use 
         ImageData.isComplexValued() to check if the data were designated as complex-valued at origination, by the 
         FITS header or the constructor.)
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="619" due-to="at88mph">
         New ArrayFuncs.sample() and .slice() methods, to provide generic support for obtaining slices and samplings
         from arrays in one or more dimensions, with the option of reversed order sampling along selected axes. 
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="attipaci" issue="590" due-to="bogdanni">
          Removed Main class, and main() entry points from JAR, which also clears up a whole lot of junk being added
          to the classpath into MANIFEST.MF.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="attipaci" issue="592">
          ArrayFuncs.convertArray(Object, Class) is now the same as  the new 
          ArrayFuncs.convertArray(Object, Class, Quantizer) method without a quantizer, and thus allows conversions 
          to/from complex valued data also, when primitive arrays have a trailing dimension of 2 (e.g. float[]..[2] 
          or int[]..[2]).
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="attipaci" issue="609">
          MultiArrayCopier.copyInto() now rounds floating point values before casting to integer types for a more 
          regular behavior.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="attipaci" issue="611">
          BinaryTable.getDouble(...) and .getLong(...) and .set(...) methods will now use the specified quantization 
          (as specified in the header or else set explicitly by the user) when converting from decimal to integer 
          types and vice-versa.

   <release version="1.19.1" date="2024-03-25" description="Bug fix release, with improved table compression support.">
      <action type="fix" dev="attipaci" issue="562" due-to="keastrid">
          Compressed tables had the ZCTYPn keywords written with a 0-based index, and thus were off-by-one in
          the FITS convention. Now fixed.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="attipaci" issue="552" due-to="keastrid">
          Fix inconsistently maintained ColumnDesc.fileSize, by replacing it with dynamic .rowLen().
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="attipaci" issue="557" due-to="keastrid">
          Fix the compression of variable-length table columns. These were completely off-spec in prior releases, 
          but are now properly supported as per the (C)FITSIO convention, which is slightly deviating from the
          documented standard. However, based on private communication with the maintainers, they are inclined
          to resolve this discrepancy by updating the standard to match the (C)FITSIO implementation, and therefore
          we adopt the (C)FITSIO way also for compressing tables. Nevertheless, we provide the static 
          CompressedTableHDU.useOldStandardIndexing(boolean) method to allow reading compressed VLA columns 
          produced in the other way also (i.e as the current standard actually describes it). Note, that our VLA 
          compression support is now much better than that of (C)FITSIO, whose current release contains multiple 
          severe bugs in that regard.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="attipaci" issue="570">
          Fix potential narrowing conversion issues uncovered by GitHub's CodeQL.
      </action>
      <action type="fix" dev="attipaci" issue="576">
          Eliminate unexpected exception thrown if trying to write an empty table to a file/stream. Now it works as
          expected.

          Find header cards with regex pattern matching with `Header.findCards()`.
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="563">
          Added support for optionless Rice and HCOMPRESS compression, using the default option values as per
          the FITS standard. As a result RICE_1 can now be used for compressing integer-type binary table
          columns.        
      </action>
      <action type="add" dev="attipaci" issue="575">
          Added support for reserving space in FITS files for future additions to binary tables in situ
          without disturbing the rest of the FITS file. Space for extra table rows can be reserved via
          BinaryTable.reserveRowSpace(int), while additional heap space for VLA additions / updates can be
          set aside by BinaryTable.reserveHeapSpace(int) prior to writing the table to a file. Note, however
          that (C)FITSIO may not be able to read files with reserved row space due to its lack of support for
          the standard THEAP keyword.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="attipaci" issue="563">
          Creating compressed tables now also checks that the requested compression algorithms are in fact 
          suitable for table compression, or else throws an IllegalArgumentException. (Currently, only the lossless 
          GZIP_1, GZIP_2, RICE_1, and NOCOMPRESS are allowed by the FITS standard for tables.)
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="attipaci" issue="567">
          The parallel table compression has previously resulted in a heap with irreproducible random ordering.
          Now, the compressed heap is ordered consistently for optimal sequential read performance.
      </action>
      <action type="update" dev="attipaci" issue="571">
          From here on we'll omit writing the THEAP keyword into binary table headers when they are not necessary
          (that is when the heap follows immediately after the main table). This allows better interoperability 
          with (C)FITSIO, which currently lacks proper support for this standard FITS keyword.

        <action type="update">
            Internal compression allows FITS files to be created where the data are efficiently stored, but the
            metadata is still easily accessible. The tiling of images is particularly critical
            for supporting efficient access to subsets of very large images. A user can easily access
            only the tiles that overlap the region of interest and can skip data not of interest.
            While some skipping might be possible with uncompressed FITS files (i.e., read only the rows
            overlapping the desired
            subset), internal tiles can be much more efficient when the image is
            substantially larger than the subset. Most compression algorithms interfere with the ability to
            skip uninteresting data, but tiles are compressed independently, so users can benefit both from
            the compression and the selection of only a subset of the image.

            Handling fixed and variable length, single and double precision
            complex data. The library uses a float[2] or double[2]
            for a complex scalar.

            This
            is mostly bug
            fixes to existing code and changes are only
            in BinaryTable and BinaryTableHDU.

            The method BinaryTableHDU.setComplexColumn() allows the user to
            tell the FITS writer
            that a field
            which otherwise would be treated
            as a float or double array (with most rapidly varying
            dimensionality of 2) should be treated as complex.
            The internal
            data
            representations are
            identical.

            Variable length complex data will be found automatically if
            number of elements actually varies. A variable length complex
            column is a 3-D float or
            double array
            where the
            last dimension (for Java) is always 2, the first
            dimension is the number of rows in the table and the middle
            dimension is the number of complex numbers in
            the row and may
            vary
            from row to row. Other variable length columns are
            represented as 2-D arrays, where the first index points to the
            row, and the second index enumerates the
            elements in the row.

            Use of complex columns is illustrated in BinaryTableTest in the routines
            testSimpleComplex (fixed columns), testVar (variable length
            columns), and
            buildByColumn and buildByRow

            These changes should not affect current usage of the existing methods.

            References to skipBytes and computeSize in the FITS classes now take
            advantage of these
            new methods.

            While these changes increase the support of the library for large datasets,
            there are still a number of restictions that arise from Java's limit that
            array indices
            must be ints. E.g., no single dimension can exceed 2 GB,
            and the total size of the heap for a given binary table HDU cannot
            exceed 2
            GB. ASCII tables may also be limited to 2 GB
            in some circumstances.
            Files which exceed these limits may be readable using line by line
            approaches, but users will need to use the library at a much lower level.

        <action type="fix" dev="tmcglynn">A bug in the creation of ASCII Table Headers was fixed.
            Some of the header cards in the header were being
            inserted as if they were comments, allowing
            multiple
            copies to be generated.
            This was also possible when a Header was created
            from an array of strings.

            deal with
            FITS data
            at the byte level. There is also a public method
            getDataSize in Header to get the size in bytes
            of the associated data element including padding.

            throw an OutOfMemory exception
            when an array cannot be created. The JVM methods seem -- in
            contradiction to the documentation -- to simply return null.
